Crass has three library dependancies that need to be installed prior to building:

libcrispr - A library for manipulating crispr files (www.ctskennerton.github.com/libcrispr)

zlib - is commonly already installed so you shouldn't have to worry about it. But 
just in case www.zlib.org

Xerces-c++ (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/) - This is an XML parsing library.  
At least one user has noticed that the binary distribution on the Xerces website is 
broken so it is recomended that the source code is downloaded and installed.  On many 
Linux distributions there will be a package for xerces, on Ubuntu this package is 
called libxerces-c3-dev, installation via your system's package manager is also fine
and should be successful.

then on most UNIX systems type:
    
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If that fails you may meed to run autogen.sh to rebuild the GNU build system for crass.
Also note that you may need to update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable if you
have installed any of the above libraries in non-standard locations.

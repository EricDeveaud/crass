Crass has two library dependancies that need to be installed prior to building:

libcrispr - A library for manipulating crispr files (www.ctskennerton.github.com/libcrispr)

zlib - is commonly already installed so you shouldn't have to worry about it. But 
just in case www.zlib.org

then on most UNIX systems type:
    
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If that fails you may meed to run autogen.sh to rebuild the GNU build system for crass

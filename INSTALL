Crass has two library dependancies that need to be installed prior to building:

zlib - is commonly already installed so you shouldn't have to worry about it 

Xerces - is freely available at http://xerces.apache.org/
note that only version 3.1.1 of Xerces has been tested and is known to work

then on most UNIX systems type:
    
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If that fails you may meed to run autogen.sh to rebuild the GNU build system for crass

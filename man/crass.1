.\"Use the .Nm macro to refer to your program throughout the man page like such:
.Nm
is a tool for finding and assembling reads from genomic and metagenomic datasets that contain 
.Ar Clustered
.Ar Regularly
.Ar Interspersed
.Ar Short
.Ar Palindromic
.Ar Repeats
(CRISPR).  
.Nm
searches through the dataset and identifies reads which contain repeated K-mers that are of a specific length and are 
separated by a spacer sequence.  These possible direct repeats are then curated internally to remove bad matches and 
then reads containing direct repeats are then outputed for further analysis.  
.Pp
The
.Nm
assembler uses the direct informtion to determine the linkages between the spacer units and outputs a .contigs file 
which contains all of the possible variations of the CRISPR based on the forking of the spacer linkages.

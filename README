cd crass

then on most Unix systems:

./configure
make
make install


SYNOPSIS
crass [-bcdhklnoswxyDSV] [--dumpReads] [--removeHomopolymers] [--logToScreen] <sequence_files>

DESCRIPTION
crass is a tool for finding and assembling reads from genomic and metagenomic datasets that contain
Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).  crass searches through the dataset and
identifies reads which contain repeated K-mers that are of a specific length and are separated by a spacer
sequence.  These possible direct repeats are then curated internally to remove bad matches and then reads
containing direct repeats are then outputed for further analysis.

OPTIONS
crass [-hV] [-b INT] [-c COLOUR_TYPE] [-d INT] [-k INT] [-l INT] [-n INT] [-o LOCATION] [-s INT] [-w INT]
[-x REAL] [-y REAL] [-D INT] [-S INT] [--dumpReads] [--removeHomopolymers] [--logToScreen]

-b INT --numBins INT
The number of colour bins for the output graph. Default is to have as many colours as there are
different values for the coverage of Nodes in the graph.

-c COLOUR_TYPE --graphColour COLOUR_TYPE
The colour scheme for the output graph based on the coverage of each spacer in the CRISPR, can be
one from:

    red-blue
    Low coverage spacers are coloured in red and high coverage spaceres are coloured blue.
    Intermediates are coloured in shades of purple.

    blue-red
    Low coverage spacers are coloured in blue and high coverage spaceres are coloured red.
    Intermediates are coloured in shades of purple.

    green-red-blue
    Three tone colouring with low coverage spacers in green and high coverage spacers in blue.

    red-blue-green
    Three tone colouring with low coverage spacers in blue and high coverage spacers in green.

-d INT --minDR INT
The minimim length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 23]

-D INT --maxDR INT
The Maximum length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 47]

--dumpReads
Prints all of the reads to file after the search is completed

-h  --help
Output basic usage informtion to screen

-l INT --logLevel INT
The level of verbosity to ouput in the crass log file

--logToScreen
Print all logging information to stdout rather than a file

-k INT --kmerCount INT
The number of kmers at two direct repeats must share to be considered part of the same cluster
[Default: 12]

-n INT --minNumRepeats INT
The minimim number of repeats that a candidate CRISPR locus must contain to be considered 'real'
[Default: 3]

--noScalling
Use the given spacer and direct repeat ranges when --removeHomopolymers is set.  The default is to
use the scale these values based on the values of -x and -y.

-o LOCATION --outDir LOCATION
The name of the ouput directory for the output files [Default: .]

-s INT --minSpacer INT
The minimim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 26]

-S INT --maxSpacer INT
The maximim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 50]

-V  --version
Print version and copy right information

-w INT --windowLength INT
The length of the window size for searching a genome.  Must be between 6 - 9 [Default: 8]

-x REAL --spacerScalling REAL
A decimal number that represents the reduction in size of the spacer when the --removeHomopolymers
option is set [Default: 0.7]

-y REAL --repeatScalling REAL
A decimal number that represents the reduction in size of the direct repeat when the --removeHo-
mopolymers option is set [Default: 0.7]

FILES
crass.log
Log file containing information about the last execution of crass

Cluster_[INT].fa
Fasta file of all reads from a cluster created when the --dumpReads option is set.

DIAGNOSTICS
The crass utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

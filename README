make install


SYNOPSIS

crass - a tool for finding CRISPRs in metagenomic datasets

crass [-dhmosDSV] sequence_files


DESCRIPTION
crass is a tool for finding and assembling reads from genomic and metagenomic 
datasets that contain Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic 
Repeats (CRISPR).  crass searches through the dataset and identifies reads 
which contain repeated K-mers that are of a specific length
and are separated by a spacer sequence.  These possible direct repeats
are then curated internally to remove bad matches and then reads containing 
direct repeats are then outputed for further analysis.

The crass assembler uses the direct informtion to determine the linkages
between the spacer units and outputs a .contigs file which contains all
of the possible variations of the CRISPR based on the forking of the
spacer linkages.


OPTIONS

-d INT   The minimim length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 23]

-D INT   The Maximum length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 47]

-h       Output basic usage informtion to screen

-m INT   The maximum number of mismatches to allow in the initial search
for direct repeats [Default: 0]

-o DIRECTORY  The name of the directory to output files [default: .]

-s INT   The minimim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 26]

-S INT   The maximim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 50]

-V       Print version and copy right information

INSTALLATION

Download the source files from git.

cd crass

then on most Unix systems:

./configure
make
make install


SYNOPSIS
crass genome [-dhwlnosDSV] <sequence_files>
crass reads [-dhklmorsDSV] [--dumpReads] READTYPE <sequence_files>

where READTYPE is one of the following:

[--illumina] [--454] [--sanger] [--genome]

DESCRIPTION
crass is a tool for finding and assembling reads from genomic and metagenomic datasets that contain Clustered
Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).  crass searches through the dataset and identifies reads
which contain repeated K-mers that are of a specific length and are separated by a spacer sequence.  These possible
direct repeats are then curated internally to remove bad matches and then reads containing direct repeats are then
outputed for further analysis.

The crass assembler uses the direct informtion to determine the linkages between the spacer units and outputs a .con-
tigs file which contains all of the possible variations of the CRISPR based on the forking of the spacer linkages.

COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
crass genome [-hV] [-d INT] [-w INT] [-l INT] [-n INT] [-o LOCATION] [-s INT] [-D INT] [-S INT]

Use crass to search a genome or set of contigs for CRISPR elements.  The algorithm is based on the one
described by

-d INT --minDR INT
The minimim length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 23]

-D INT --maxDR INT
The Maximum length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 47]

-h  --help
Output basic usage informtion to screen

-w INT --windowLength INT
The length of the window size for searching a genome.  Must be between 6 - 9 [Default: 8]

-l INT --logLevel INT
The level of verbosity to ouput in the crass log file

-n INT --minNumRepeats INT
The minimim number of repeats that a candidate CRISPR locus must contain to be considered 'real'
[Default: 3]

-o LOCATION --outDir LOCATION
The name of the ouput directory for the output files [Default: .]

-s INT --minSpacer INT
The minimim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 26]

-S INT --maxSpacer INT
The maximim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 50]

-V  --version
Print version and copy right information

crass reads [-hrV] [-d INT] [-k INT] [-l INT] [-m INT] [-o LOCATION] [-s INT] [-D INT] [-S INT] [--dumpReads]
[--454] [--illumina] [-sanger]

--454    Specify that the input files have been sourced from 454 sequencing

-d INT --minDR INT
The minimim length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 23]

-D INT --maxDR INT
The Maximum length of the direct repeat to search for [Default: 47]

--dumpReads
Prints all of the reads to file after the search is completed

-h  --help
Output basic usage informtion to screen
--illumina
Specify that the input files have been sourced from illumina sequencing

-k INT --kmerCount INT
The number of kmers at two direct repeats must share to be considered part of the same cluster
[Default: 8]

-l INT --logLevel INT
The level of verbosity to ouput in the crass log file

-m INT --maxMismatches INT
The maximum number of mismatches to allow in the initial search for direct repeats [Default: 0]

-o LOCATION --outDir LOCATION
The name of the ouput directory for the output files [Default: .]

-r  --reportStats
Output a statistics report on the CRISPR found by crass

-s INT --minSpacer INT
The minimim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 26]

-S INT --maxSpacer INT
The maximim length of the spacer to search for [Default: 50]

--sanger
Specify that the input files have been sourced from sanger sequencing

-V  --version
Print version and copy right information

FILES
crass.log
Log file containing information about the last execution of crass

Cluster_[INT].fa
Fasta file of all reads from a cluster created when the --dumpReads option is set.

crass.contigs
Fasta file containing the assembled CRISPR regions

crass.stats
Delimited text file containing statistics on the CRISPR found by crass.  By default the delimiter is set to
"\t" however this can be changed with -b

DIAGNOSTICS
The crass utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
